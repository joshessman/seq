Calling Python from Seq
=======================

Calling Python from Seq is possible in two ways:

- ``pyimport`` allows importing and calling Python functions from existing Python modules.
- ``pydef`` allows writing Python code directly in Seq.

In order to use these features, the ``SEQ_PYTHON`` environment variable must be set to the appropriate
Python shared library:

.. code-block:: bash

    export SEQ_PYTHON=/path/to/libpython.X.Y.so

For example, with a ``brew``-installed Python 3.7 on macOS, this might be
``/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/libpython3.7m.dylib``.
Note that only Python versions 3.6 and later are supported.

``pyimport``
------------

Let's say we have a Python function defined in *mymodule.py*:

.. code-block:: python

    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b

We can call this function in Seq using ``pyimport``:

.. code-block:: seq

    from mymodule pyimport multiply () -> int
    print multiply(3, 4)  # 12

(Be sure the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable includes the path of *mymodule.py*!)

Be sure to pass ``()`` to ``pyimport`` regardless of the number of arguments the Python function takes;
Seq will pass all arguments at invocation time (e.g. ``multiply(1, 2)``). This is useful if the number
of arguments to a given Python functions is variable.

``pydef``
---------

Seq programs can contains functions that will be executed by Python via ``pydef``:

.. code-block:: seq

    pydef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a * b

    print multiply(3, 4)  # 12

This makes calling Python modules like NumPy very easy:

.. code-block:: seq

    pydef myrange(n: int) -> list[int]:
        from numpy import arange
        return list(arange(n))

    print myrange(5)  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


.. caution::
    Currently, any code within a ``pydef`` block must be valid Seq code. Thus, words such as
    ``extend``, ``match``, ``case``, ``pydef``, ``cimport``, ``pyimport``, ``type``, ``typeof``
    and ``prefetch`` are reserved and you will not be able to use such words as identifiers in
    your Python code. This restriction will be lifted in later versions of Seq.
